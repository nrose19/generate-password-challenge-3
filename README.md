# Generate Password: Challenge 3

## Description
This challenge is based around JavaScript and focuses on the generation of randomized passwords. The idea is to hit the 'Generate Password' button and to be met with a series of prompts, regarding what you would like your password to contain. After answering said prompts, a random password should be generated, keeping your answers in mind. This not only is helpful with regards to understanding JavaScript, but also is handy for future password use.
